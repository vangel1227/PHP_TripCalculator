<p>Here is a collection of some of my PHP projects. All of these were self taught, studying through various mediums (books, YouTube, articles, blogs, etc.). In addition to the self taught PHP and MySQL, I also implemented some basic utilization of bootstrap.
    If you'd like to amend the looks of the site feel free to check out the documentation for Bootstrap <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Here</a>.

<p>
    Projects included here are a trip calculator with a variety of forms that will either retain or delete the information once 
    submitted illustrating the importance of how you write your code and the attributes of your HTML forms. Also Exercising using a 
    variety of elements (inputs, radio buttons, comboboxes, functions, etc.). The Calculator will not accept decmial value unlike the 
    Calculator MPG which is due to the step attribute which you'll notice in the code (step="0.01"). Pay attention to slight variations
    in code between the pages and individual forms.
